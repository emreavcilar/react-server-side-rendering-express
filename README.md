This is a simple react server side rendering template example. This template mainly includes;

<ul>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Express</li>
    <li>Redux</li>
    <li>Axios</li>
</ul>

and some other helper libraries.


**Setup**

**yarn install**
or
**npm install**

if you are working on your local please run

**node start-server.js**

if you are on server please run

**pm2 start start-server.js**

Please attention that there is no watch and auto building so you need run 

**npm run build**

and put build js (and other assets files) into assets directory after each changes.
